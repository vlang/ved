Ved - a fast Vim-like editor written in V.

Ved works best with workspaces (directories with code).
You can have multiple workspaces and quickly switch between them with `C [` and `C ]`.

To open multiple workspaces, run

ved path/to/project1 path/to/project2

If you never used vim before press `j` to move down

Key bindings:

"C" means the Apple key on macOS, control key on all other systems.

C o    open a file
C s    save
C r    reload current file
C p    open ctrlp (fuzzy search)
/      search in current file
C g    copy current file's path to clipboard

gd     go to definition

C c    git commit -am
C -    git diff
?      git grep (search across all files in current workspace)

C u    build current project (build instructions must be located in "build")
C y    alternative build of the current project (build instructions must be located in "build2")
C 1    switch to Ved from any other application (only on macOS for now)

### .ved configuration file for each workspace
Add a `.ved` json config file to the root of your workspace. Right now it supports the following options:

```json
{
	"grep_file_extensions": ["go", "v"] // File extensions that git grep should search in. Everything else is ignored.
}
```
